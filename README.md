# SG_Estimation_Wildfires
The research in point processes applies the Stoyan-Grabarnik statistic, which requires less compute compared to maximum likelihood estimation, to estimate the likelihood of ignited wildfires. Models are made using various combinations of weather variables. Models are further segmented by natural and human-caused fires, and also models are tested for a wildfires in only Southern California.
